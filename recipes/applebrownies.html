    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was my Mom's recipe. Easy and quick to make. 
        Apples and walnuts are packed into a cinnamon spiced 
        blonde brownie. Always a hit when I bring it to 
        parties. Very moist and great to make in the fall 
        when apples are plentiful.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 medium apples- peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat together the melted butter, 
                sugar, and egg until fluffy. Fold in the apples and 
                walnuts. In a separate bowl, sift together the 
                flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. 
                Stir the flour mixture into the wet mixture until just 
                blended. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared baking 
                dish.</li>
                <li>Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a 
                    toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
